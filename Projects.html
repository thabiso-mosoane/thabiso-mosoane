                          I designed an online dashboard enabling users to monitor their financial status, set goals, and receive personalized financial planning recommendations. The project leveraged libraries such as Matplotlib and NumPy, with C++ utilized for efficient data processing, optimization, and ensuring security.

                          I developed a smart traffic management system that utilizes real-time data to optimize traffic flow, minimize congestion, and enhance road safety. The system was implemented using Python for traffic flow optimization, data analysis, and real-time decision-making, while C++ was employed for traffic signal control and integration with IoT devices.

                          I developed an inventory management system for an e-commerce platform that automates stock tracking, restocking, and order fulfillment. The system was designed using Python and C++ to optimize inventory algorithms, facilitate barcode scanning, and integrate with warehouse robotics.
